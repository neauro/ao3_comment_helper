## wish it was easier to leave feedback for writers on Ao3?

well here u go!

this chrome extension helps you put together comments that look like this.

### How to use
<strong>rirst, [install the chrome extension](https://twitter.com/suchnadine).</strong>

the chrome extension will only be active when you're viewing a work on Ao3. when it's active, you'll see the comment helper appear on the bottom of the work.

when you highlight text, the comment helper will open up automatically. you'll see the quoted text on the left, and can write your comment on the right.

then you can press the "Add to AO3 comment" button to add this button to your comment text area.

<strong>IMPORTANT: once you are done, you still need to click Ao3's "Comment" button to actually leave the comment on the fic!</strong>
